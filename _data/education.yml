    This period is worth to consolidate what we have already learnt in my previous degree. 
    It also provided new knowledge and interesting subjects related to work experience.

    Currently I share my time between studying and working.

    During the first years we basically learn about problem solving and the basis of our profession.
    Then we are told to choose an especiality, which in my case was Software Engineering.
    
    The last year of my degree I decided to share my time between studies and my final degree project, in order to get some experience in the real world.
