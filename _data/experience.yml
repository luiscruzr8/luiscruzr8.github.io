    Working for the first time while I was finishing my final BSc Project simultaneously. 
    
    Starting here gave me a taste of the real world, where I was able to learn new methodologies, new technologies and so far and so forth.
    I got lucky to work hand in hand with very capable team from developers to QA testers and UI/UX designers. I cherish this first opportunity to have a glance of the real world.
