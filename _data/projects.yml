    GeoGuardian is an Android app design to monitor user's movements, in order to send a notification to a person or persons of your trust whether an unexpected event happen during that time.

    This app enables the users to create routes so they can arrive to their destination and allows them create also safety and danger zones. 
    In any case, the app will send notifications if the users don't get to their destination, they go out of safety zones or they go inside danger zones.

    It is especially designed for unsupervised children, people with demetia or disabilites, transporters of valuables goods or people who want to feel safer when traveling through unstrusted areas or roads.

    This was a team project, during my MSc. This app was made by 6 students (including myself), as an assignment.
