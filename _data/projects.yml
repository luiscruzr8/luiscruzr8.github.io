    GeoGuardian is an Android app designed to monitor users movements, in order to send a notification to a person or persons of your trust if an unexpected event happens during that time.

    This app enables the users to create routes so they can arrive to their destination and also allows them to create safe and danger zones. 
    In any case, the app will send notifications if the users don't get to their destination, they go out of safe zones or they go inside danger zones.

    It is especially designed for unsupervised children, people with demetia or impairment, transporters of valuables goods or people who want to feel safer when traveling through unstrusted areas or roads.

    This was a team project, during my MSc. This app was made by 6 students (including myself), as an assignment.
